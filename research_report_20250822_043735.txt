Page: XZ Utils backdoor
Summary: In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name "Jia Tan". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution through OpenSSH on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.
While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.

Page: Supply chain attack
Summary: A supply chain attack is a cyber-attack that seeks to damage an organization by targeting less secure elements in the supply chain. A supply chain attack can occur in any industry, from the financial sector, oil industry, to a government sector. A supply chain attack can happen in software or hardware. Cybercriminals typically tamper with the manufacturing or distribution of a product by installing malware or hardware-based spying components. Symantec's 2019 Internet Security Threat Report states that supply chain attacks increased by 78 percent in 2018.
A supply chain is a system of activities involved in handling, distributing, manufacturing, and processing goods in order to move resources from a vendor into the hands of the final consumer. A supply chain is a complex network of interconnected players governed by supply and demand.
Although supply chain attack is a broad term without a universally agreed upon definition, in reference to cyber-security, a supply chain attack can involve physically tampering with electronics (computers, ATMs, power systems, factory data networks) in order to install undetectable malware for the purpose of bringing harm to a player further down the supply chain network. Alternatively, the term can be used to describe attacks exploiting the software supply chain, in which an apparently low-level or unimportant software component used by other software can be used to inject malicious code into the larger software that depends on the component.
In a more general sense, a supply chain attack may not necessarily involve electronics. In 2010 when burglars gained access to the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly's supply warehouse, by drilling a hole in the roof and loading $80 million worth of prescription drugs into a truck, they could also have been said to carry out a supply chain attack. However, this article will discuss cyber attacks on physical supply networks that rely on technology; hence, a supply chain attack is a method used by cyber-criminals.



Page: Linus's law
Summary: In software development, Linus's law is the assertion that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".
The law was formulated by Eric S. Raymond in his essay and book The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1999), and was named in honor of Linus Torvalds.
A more formal statement is: "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone." Presenting the code to multiple developers with the purpose of reaching consensus about its acceptance is a simple form of software reviewing. Researchers and practitioners have repeatedly shown the effectiveness of reviewing processes in finding bugs and security issues.

The discovery sent cybersecurity experts, including the Binarly REsearch team, scrambling to reverse engineer the backdoor to understand its scope and potential impact. In short, the backdoor was embedded in the liblzma.so library, which is used by the OpenSSH server, and is triggered when a client interacts with the infected SSH server. The final goal of the malicious code is to install three hooks in the context of sshd process, targeting the RSA_public_decrypt, RSA_get0_key, and EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA functions, thereby enabling backdoor functionality. This is achieved through a sophisticated sequence of hooks, initiated by modified IFUNC resolvers for lzma_crc32 and lzma_crc64 in the liblzma.so library. Last year, we released a comprehensive analysis detailing the hook chain and the backdoor’s functionality.What really stood out in this story is that the backdoor’s impact wasn’t just theoretical, as malicious xz-utils packages containing the backdoor were distributed by several major Linux distributions, including Debian, Fedora and OpenSUSE. This had serious implications for the software supply chain, as it became challenging to quickly identify all the places where the backdoored library had been included. Within 24 hours, Binarly released XZ.fail, a free static analysis-based tool designed to detect suspicious IFUNC resolvers with near-zero false positives.In this blog, we share a new finding in the XZ Utils saga: several Docker images built around the time of the compromise contain the backdoor. At first glance, this might not seem alarming: if the distribution packages were backdoored, then any Docker images based on them would be infected as well. However, what we discovered is that some of these compromised images are still publicly available on Docker Hub. And even more troubling, other images have been built on top of these infected base images, making them transitively infected.In all, we identified more than 35 images that ship with the backdoor. While this may seem like a small number, we only scanned a small portion of the images published on DockerHub, stopping at second-order images. Additionally, we focused solely on Debian images, as they retain historical data on Docker Hub. The impact on Docker... [Content truncated for length]

More troubling is the fact that other images have been built on top of these infected base images, effectively propagating the infection further in a transitive manner, Binarly REsearch said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The firmware security company said it discovered a total of 35 images that ship with the backdoor. The incident once again highlights the risks faced by the software supply chain. Binarly's Alex Matrosov told the publication that the investigation was prompted after it detected malicious code in one of their customer's environments, ultimately finding that the images had been pulled from Docker Hub. The XZ Utils supply chain event (CVE-2024-3094, CVSS score: 10.0) came to light in late March 2024, when Andres Freund sounded the alarm on a backdoor embedded within XZ Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. Further analysis of the malicious code and the broader compromise led to several startling discoveries, the first and foremost being that the backdoor could lead to unauthorized remote access and enable the execution of arbitrary payloads through SSH. Specifically, the backdoor – placed in the liblzma.so library and used by the OpenSSH server – was designed such that it triggered when a client interacts with the infected SSH server. By hijacking the RSA_public_decrypt function using the glibc's IFUNC mechanism, the malicious code allowed an attacker possessing a specific private key to bypass authentication and execute root commands remotely," Binarly explained. The second finding was that the changes were pushed by a developer named "Jia Tan" (JiaT75), who spent almost two years contributing to the open-source project to build trust until they were given maintainer responsibilities, signaling the meticulous nature of the attack. "This is clearly a very complex state-sponsored operation with impressive sophistication and multi-year planning," Binarly noted at the time. "Such a complex and professionally designed comprehensive implantation framework is not developed for a one-shot operation." The latest research from the compa... [Content truncated for length]
